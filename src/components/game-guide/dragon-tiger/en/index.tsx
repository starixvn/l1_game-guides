                    <ul className="desc">
                        <li>Two cards are drawn, one for the Dragon and one for the Tiger. </li>
                        <li>
                            The players bet on Dragon or Tiger which one will win with the higher value card. The players can also bet on
                            “Tie” option if they predict Dragon and Tiger will have the same value card, irrespective of suit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The game determines the win or loss by comparing the point of the card instead of its suit. K is the maximum,
                            while Ace is the minimum.
                        </li>

                                    The ranking of cards from the lowest to the highest is as follows: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
                                    Jack, Queen, and King.

                                <li>
                                    Ace stands for 1 point; Jack is 11 points; Queen stands for 12 points and King is 13 points. The rest of
                                    the cards (2 to 10) are counted at face value.
                                </li>
