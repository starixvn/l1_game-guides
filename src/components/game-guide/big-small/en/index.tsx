                            If the total amounts bet on BIG and SMALL are different then the gap amount will be refunded to the players who

                                <strong>Example:</strong> Player A bets 100 on BIG, player B bets 40 on SMALL, and C bets 80 on SMALL. To
                                balance the total amounts bet on BIG and SMALL, the system will refund 20 to player C.
